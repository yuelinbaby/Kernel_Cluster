## Overview

BANKSY is a method for clustering spatial transcriptomic data by
augmenting the transcriptomic profile of each cell with an average of
the transcriptomes of its spatial neighbors. By incorporating
neighborhood information for clustering, BANKSY is able to

-   improve cell-type assignment in noisy data
-   distinguish subtly different cell-types stratified by
    microenvironment
-   identify spatial zones sharing the same microenvironment

BANKSY is applicable to a wide array of spatial technologies (e.g.Â 10x
Visium, Slide-seq, MERFISH) and scales well to large datasets. For more
details, check out:

-   and a [Python version](https://github.com/prabhakarlab/Banksy_py) of
    this package.

## Installation

The *Banksy* package can be installed via `remotes`:

``` r
remotes::install_github("prabhakarlab/Banksy", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Installation should take less than three minutes.
