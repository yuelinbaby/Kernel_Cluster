## Overview

BANKSY is a method for clustering spatial transcriptomic data by
augmenting the transcriptomic profile of each cell with an average of
the transcriptomes of its spatial neighbors. By incorporating
neighborhood information for clustering, BANKSY is able to

-   improve cell-type assignment in noisy data
-   distinguish subtly different cell-types stratified by
    microenvironment
-   identify spatial zones sharing the same microenvironment

BANKSY is applicable to a wide array of spatial technologies (e.g.Â 10x
Visium, Slide-seq, MERFISH) and scales well to large datasets. For more
details, check out:

    [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.14.488259v1),

    this package.

## Installation

The *Banksy* package can be installed via `remotes`:

``` r
remotes::install_github("prabhakarlab/Banksy", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Installation should take less than three minutes.

Installation should take less than three minutes.

**Known installation issues**

1.  Installation of `leidenAlg` has non-zero exit status

-   Refer to the [package
    website](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/leidenAlg#installation)
    for *leidenAlg* installation details. Otherwise, users may also
    install a separate branch of *Banksy* with

``` r
remotes::install_github("prabhakarlab/Banksy@feat-igraph-leiden")
```

## Documentation

Detailed description of *Banksy* functionality and example analyses are
available at the [package
webpage](https://prabhakarlab.github.io/Banksy/).

*Banksy* comes installed with
[documentation](https://prabhakarlab.github.io/Banksy/reference/index.html)
of main functions and their usage, along with several vignettes which
detail different use cases:

-   [Working with Banksy
    objects](https://prabhakarlab.github.io/Banksy/articles/banksy-object.html):
    Introduction to the *BanksyObject* class which serves as a container
    for *Banksy*.

-   [Mouse hippocampus VeraFISH
    dataset](https://prabhakarlab.github.io/Banksy/articles/hippocampus-analysis.html):
    Illustrates a grid search of parameters which best cluster cells.

-   [Human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 10x Visium
    dataset](https://prabhakarlab.github.io/Banksy/articles/dlpfc-analysis.html):
    Illustrates analysis of multiple spatial transcriptomic datasets.
*Banksy* is also interoperable with
[Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) via *SeuratWrappers*.
Documentation on how to run BANKSY on Seurat objects can be found
[here](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-wrappers/blob/master/docs/banksy.md).
